# Updated spectra of stable particles from dark matter

We provide the spectra of the cosmic messengers such as $\bar{p}, e^+, \gamma$ or $\nu$ at the production for various annihilation channels and dark matter masses. In this case, we use PYTHIA version 8.310 and the VINCIA antenna shower algorithm. The spectra is generated for dark-matter masses between $5$ GeV and $100$ TeV (with a grid of 64 mass values) and 25 annihilation channels. The annhilation channels considered in this work are 

$$
\chi \chi \to e_L^+ e_L^-, e_R^+ e_R^-, e^+ e^-, \mu_L^+ \mu_L^-, \mu_R^+ \mu_R^-, \mu^+ \mu^-
$$
