# Updated spectra of stable particles from dark matter

We provide the spectra of the cosmic messengers such as $\bar{p}, e^+, \gamma$ or $\nu$ at the production for various annihilation channels and dark matter masses. In this case, we use \textsc{Pythia} version 8.310 and the VINCIA antenna shower algorithm.
